// This shows how StringBUilder Works in java
// StringBuilder Vs StringBUffers
/*
StringBuffer is the thread safe utility class to perform several operations on Strings. 
It contains append() and insert() methods that are widely used to perform operation 
on Strings in a multi-thread environment. Most of its 
functions are synchronized for thread safety.

Since most of the String operations, for example concatenation happens in a single thread environment, 
Java 1.5 introduced another utility class StringBuilder to perform similar operations but doesnâ€™t provide 
thread safety. All the methods are unsynchronized.
